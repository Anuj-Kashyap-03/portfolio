Welcome to My Personal Portfolio, a full-featured Next.js web application. This application is built using a variety of popular libraries and frameworks, including React, Material UI, and Emotion, among others.


The application is built with the latest version of Next.js and features a custom Next.js theme that leverages the Material UI library for styling. Additionally, the application is configured to use TypeScript, ensuring type safety and improved code readability.


The application also utilizes a number of other libraries to provide additional functionality, including AOS for animating elements on scroll, Framer Motion for animating components, and Swiper for creating swiping carousels.


To get started, simply clone the repository and run npm install to install the required dependencies. From there, you can run npm run dev to start the application in development mode, or npm run build to build the application for production.


I hope you find this application useful and I look forward to seeing what you build with it!
